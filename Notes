Exception.hpp:
    - Added exception class heirarchies for both Kalah and Game:
        - KalahIllegalMove is the base class for Kalah exceptions:
            - InvalidHouseNumber and InvalidEmptyPit are derived classes for specific
              Kalah exceptions
        - GameException is the base class for Game exceptions:
            - LostConnection, LowLevelStreamError, and Quit are derived classes for
              specific Game exceptions
    - Uses virtual print() function from base class that each of the derived classes
      override with their own implementation

Snapshot.hpp/Snapshot.cpp:
    - print() function redirects to "ostream& out" to "kalah.state" file
    - read() parses the remaining integers of the file representing each pit on the
      Kalah board adding them to a "vector<int>" list

Startup.hpp/Startup.cpp:
    - Parses the arguments, checking that the correct number and type of arguments
      are given
    - Reads the first two tokens in the "kalah.state" file to retrieve the number of
      houses and the current active player (if "-r" argument is present)

Game.cpp:
    - playGame():
        - throws exceptions for low-level stream errors
        - catches both Kalah and Game specific errors, calling their print functions
    - saveState():
        - creates the Snapshot object
        - create the output file "kalah.state"
        - catches any fatal errors during saving
    - restoreState():
        - calls Kalah::restoreState()
        - catches any fatal errors during restoring

Kalah.cpp:
    - isValidMove(): throws exceptions for invalid input errors
    - saveState():
        - sets the Snapshot activePlayer
        - calls Board::saveSeedsState()
    - restoreState():
        - sets the currentPlayer
        - sets each player's house and store seed counts
        - calls Board::restoreSeedState() to set up the board pits

Board.cpp:
    - saveSeedsState(): adds all pit seeds to the Snapshot "vector<int>" seeds list
    - restoreSeedsState(): adds seeds to each of the pits from the Snapshot seeds list
